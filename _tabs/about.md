## About Me

I build, analyze, and document ideas in public.

This site functions as both a knowledge archive and a professional portfolio — a place where research, projects, and structured thinking are published transparently.

---

## What I Do

- Technical exploration  
- Research documentation  
- System and strategic analysis  
- Building digital projects  
- Long-term thinking and experimentation  

---

## This Site Is

- A portfolio of selected work  
- A public lab for ideas  
- A documentation system  
- A structured thinking space  

Everything here reflects real work, real experimentation, and continuous iteration.

---

## Working Philosophy

- Signal over noise  
- Depth over surface  
- Structure over chaos  
- Clarity over decoration  

---

## Current Direction

Focused on building leverage through:

- Technical skill development  
- Research-based writing  
- Strategic digital projects  

This is a long-term build.
